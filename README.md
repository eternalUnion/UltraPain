# ULTRAPAIN - Configurable Difficulty Mod
ULTRAPAIN is a mod that adds several unique mechanics to the game in order to allow the player to fine tune their difficulty as well as adding some brand new shiny tech. You can make the game as lenient- or as difficult- as you so desire.
## Enemy Tweaks
Every enemy, fodder to miniboss, has at least one unique change that can be configured. For example, Filth now explode on contact with the player, and Soldiers fire more than one burst of projectiles, plus a core. Every enemy can be fine-tuned to a player's preference, whether that's making the game hell, or simply relaxing.
## Player Tweaks
There are also new techniques added, such as Grenade Parrying, Rocket Parrying, Freezeframe Rocket Grappling, and Orbital Strikes. Everything is highly configurable, from the style bonus text and style points granted for performing a move, to damage and explosion size values.
